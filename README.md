1) The home screen is a simple search bar, if you select the icon in the upper right corner you are introduced with the nav bar and dynamic options based on if the user is logged in or not. If logged in you will see an option for "See Your Books" to view books you've saved.

3) After you search for a book you are met with the search results/cards. The cards change whether the user is logged in or not. If the user is logged in they will have a button at the bottom of the card that allows them to add the book to refer to later, if not they will just see the card but can still search for books.

4) If a user decides to save a book this is what it will look like on "their" page, they also will see above the books how many books have been saved, if any.
